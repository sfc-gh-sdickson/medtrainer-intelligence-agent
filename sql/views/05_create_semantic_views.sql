-- MedTrainer Intelligence Agent - Semantic Views
-- ============================================================================
-- Purpose: Create semantic views for Snowflake Intelligence agents
-- All syntax VERIFIED against official documentation:
-- https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-semantic-view
-- 
-- Syntax Verification Notes:
-- 1. Clause order is MANDATORY: TABLES → RELATIONSHIPS → DIMENSIONS → METRICS → COMMENT
-- 2. Semantic expression format: semantic_name AS sql_expression
-- 3. No self-referencing relationships allowed
-- 4. No cyclic relationships allowed
-- 5. PRIMARY KEY columns must exist in table definitions
