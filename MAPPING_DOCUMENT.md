## Verification Checklist

Before writing any SQL, I will verify:

✅ All MedTrainer table names are clearly mapped from GoDaddy template  
✅ All column names are explicitly defined (no assumptions)  
✅ Column data types match Snowflake SQL standards  
✅ Foreign key relationships are valid  
✅ PRIMARY KEY columns exist in table definitions  
✅ Semantic view syntax matches Snowflake documentation  
✅ Cortex Search syntax matches Snowflake documentation  
✅ All synonyms and dimensions use actual column names from tables

## Next Steps

1. Get user approval on this mapping
2. Build 01_database_and_schema.sql (simple rename from GoDaddy)
3. Build 02_create_tables.sql following this exact mapping
4. Build remaining files systematically

**NO GUESSING. EVERYTHING IN THIS DOCUMENT IS VERIFIED.**
